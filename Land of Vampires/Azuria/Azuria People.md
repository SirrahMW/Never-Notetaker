# The Peoples of Azuria

## The Faer Folk  
The history of the “Faer Folk,” including the different Faer races and subraces as well as a few examples of fae civilizations across Azuria.  
### History of the Faer Folk  
Though the accounts of fae origins naturally differ between the various races and cultures included in this grouping, most agree that the fae first appeared when the Titan of Nature, Verdigris, split herself in three to form the planes of life. As she did so, Verdigris transformed into three elder fae: Enid  
(Brightlands), Evelyn (Shadowlands), and Lyric (prime plane). Each of these three became the reya, or queen, of the fae of their respective realms and, when they passed on from their mortal lives, became goddesses for the fae peoples. Like Verdigris herself, the three elder fae possessed the ability to replicate aspects of themselves, a process from which their daughters were born. After the three elder fae passed on into the celestial realms, their daughters became the rules of the fae peoples of Azuria. During Alessandra’s rebellion against the titans, the fae of the Shadow- and Brightlands retreated to their home planes. Alessandra’s fury rained hardest over  
the prime plane, destroying all but the best-hidden fae peoples. Their only hope for survival was intermingling among themselves and the Lycan who walked the plane. And from them, the first elves and the merfolk came into being.

## The Fae Races  
The divisions that have marked the worlds of Eldura and Azuria from their inception have also led to onomastic disagreements regarding the differentiation between the various members of the fae. The relative lack of fae peoples on the prime plane adds to this confusion, emphasizing the  
singular expression of narrow communities over the flourishing of adaptive varieties of fae in the Brightlands especially (hence their name, the Fae Brightlands). For simplicity’s sake, the following, non-exhaustive list includes the known expressions of fae on the prime plane without the more intricate mingling common to the Brightlands communities.  

### The Fae  
Alternatively known as First Fae, this grouping refers to the Brightlands fae and Shadowlands fae and not the fae folk in general. These fae resemble humanoids with upright torsos, two arms, and two legs, though they show greater variety in skin tones and tend to possess wings, either physical or spectral, and some have horns and antlers as well. Like their elven descendants, fae can also bear resemblances or aspects of natural elements, such as skin patterned or textured as bark. Fae ears are large, usually stretching over the top of the fae’s head.  
#### Brightlands Fae  
The Brightlands fae generally live in one of the four seasonal courts in the Brightlands, and their dress and appearance often express the unique characteristics of that court. Fae from the Autumn Court, for example, have skin tones and hair that resemble the color of autumn leaves. Wings are less  
common among the Brightlands fae than their Shadowlands cousins.
#### Shadowlands Fae  
From a culture born out of shadow and mist, these fae learn from an early age to defend themselves and their own. Around one in three of their number possess wings, the spectral variety being more common than feathered wings that remain visible at all times. A fae gar (child) born with physical wings signifies great change afoot and warns the community to prepare for calamity. The skin tones of these fae arise from a world of shadow—sepia, gray, and umbral being some of the most common. 

### The Adaptive Fae  
#### Centaur  
Centaurs are muscular, hair-covered fae with furry, faun-like ears and sharp teeth. Their lower half resembles the four legs and body of a horse, though with coarser hair like a bear’s, and their torso that of a partially transformed werewolf. They are the watchers and guardians of the natural world and  
territorial in where each clan roams.

>[!info] The Hoofheart Clan  
The Hoofheart Clan roams the wild forests of the Elven Realms with the aid of their dire wolf hunting companions, said to have descended from the daimon. They carefully attune their movements to the stars overhead and the signs of the earth, conscious of Gaia’s will even if the Titan of Earth has long since left the prime plane of Azuria.

#### Harpy  
Birdlike fae with gemstone-colored wings and the head, shoulders, and chest of their fae ancestors. Most harpies in a flock are female, with only a few males born each year. Called the “sirens of the sky,” the harpies’ magical song conjures emotion-tied memories of those who cross into their territory.  
They might trigger a creature’s sense of fear, for example, if they wanted to warn off an intruder, or arouse a creature’s sense of goodwill and comradery if they were looking for allies in a particular region. 

>[!info] The Windsong Harpies  
One flock of harpies has lived in the Old Bastion Highlands since the collapse of Eldura. They hide away in the mountains, eliminating roaming scouts and werewolves sent by the Andel-ce Hevran Empire to protect their roost.  

#### Satyr  
Urban-dwelling fae with hairy hinds and colorful fae torsos, satyrs freely roam the lands of Azuria and are the most commonly seen of the adaptive fae beyond the Bright- and Shadowlands. 

#### Renard  
Fox-folk, tricky and charming, most of whom have not ventured beyond the confines of the fae courts where they have resided for millennia.  

#### Nymph  
Fae mistresses of the natural world, nymphs encompass several different types of embodied nature spirits who closely tie themselves to their individual environments.  

#### Dryad  
Nymphs of the forests, dryads live in ancient trees and in the heart places of the worlds’ woods. They attune themselves to the wood wide web stretching beneath the trees and listen to stories borne upon windswept branches.  

#### Alseid  
Caretakers of groves and glades, alseids roam small forests, tending to their needs, and care for the glades between the trees, where they protect the meeting of earth and sky.  

#### Oread  
Unlike many of their sister nymphs who have dedicated themselves to protecting a particular environment, oreads roam highland and mountain regions, seeking to unite the cultures and beings who cross over them. Early on in the birth of their species, oreads recognized the unique nature of the mountains—places of both division and unity. Where else do borders meet, do peoples cross? And so they became storytellers, guiding travelers on their journeys and sending tales across borders to help the peoples of the world recognize that their histories, stories, and experiences are shared rather than singular.  

#### Naiada  
At the dawn of the planes of life, the goddess of memory and the goddess of fate together created these nymph mistresses of the ocean waves. The goddesses charged the naiada, the ancestors of the merfolk, with the memories of the sea and all who dwelled there. The few remaining naiada now dwell in remote undersea caves, wise hermits who hold the memories of their plane and the changing nature of the sea and tides close to their hearts. Those who would seek the wisdom of the first age could hardly find a more reliable teacher, so long as they were able to understand the naiada’s changing memory-song. 

### The Faery Races  
#### Faeries  
The smallest fae in Azuria, faeries possess bright, colorful wings and live in close-knit communities. They have developed several protective mechanisms to ward off dangerous outsiders. As one example, when several faeries speak at once, their voices take on the cadence of sounds in the environment, such as the wind in the trees or water flowing through a brook. Most faeries have bark-like skin, and several adopt smaller creatures, sure as fireflies, as pets.

### The Elves  
#### Elves  
Sometimes known as lumen or surface elves, the aboveground-dwelling elves of Azuria are the most commonly seen by the world’s other races and cultures. Although there are native elven residents in each of the world’s major cities and regions, the height of elven civilization can be found in the Elven Realms themselves, home to three distinctive cities. In appearance, elven ears are smaller than those of their fae brethren, usually extending several inches beyond those of humans. Their skin tones reflect the variety of the forest, from the pale white of a birch tree to the gray-black of the ironbark. Their extremities can also vary in color, with fingertips tinged the color of vibrant mosses or the soft shades of lichen.  

#### Umbral Elves  
Umbral elves are residents of the Underland, the vast system of caverns and caves that stretches far beneath the surface of each of the Planes of Life. The Underland is as expansive and diverse as any of the above-ground regions of Azuria, though it is dangerous for those unfamiliar with the dark. Unlike surface-dwelling elves, umbral elves have pale, bioluminescent skin that ranges from shades of white to glowing blues, greens, and purples. Over generations, they have adapted to life below ground. Their enlarged pupils allow them to see in the dark, and they possess antennae, either from the tops of their heads or growing along their arms and shoulders, that help them navigate the vast reaches of the Underland.  

#### Merfolk/Sirens  
Descendants of the naiada, most merfolk live in the city of Nepta, one of the only still-surviving cities from the world of Eldura. They possess fins instead of legs alongside webbed fingers and gills, and their coloration follows the variety found on a coral reef, from bright coral to turquoise, magenta, emerald, and violet. A branch of their species, the sirens, possess innate natural magic, born from their connection to the sea and the elements of water.
