# Steymhorod’s Major Cities

There are three major cities in <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font>: <font color="#ffff00">Saint Sebastian</font>, <font color="#ffff00">Barasov</font>, and <font color="#ffff00">Rasonov</font>. The <font color="#7030a0">Witchwood</font> is home to the witches and their servitors, and the town of <font color="#ffff00">Willowhold</font> rests inside the forest’s borders. The village <font color="#ffff00">Umbra</font> sits at the base of <font color="#00b050">Castle Cadogan</font>; a pack of werewolves make their den at <font color="#7030a0">Wolf’s Head Peak</font>, and a collection of fae and druids secretly dwell within the <font color="#7030a0">Green Vale</font>. The desecrated temples to the Four Fane Sisters lie in the heart of each natural element—the mountains, the rivers, the forests, and the fields.

## Saint Sebastian

The walled city of <font color="#ffff00">Saint Sebastian</font> is the first the adventurers are likely to come across upon their arrival in <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font>. The population of <font color="#ffff00">Saint Sebastian</font> is aging rapidly, most of their young residents leaving to join the **Ring of Light**, a cult that surrounds the city walls, or traveling to the city of <font color="#ffff00">Barasov</font> for greater excitement and opportunity. 

The mayor of <font color="#ffff00">Saint Sebastian</font> is an ancient human male named <font color="#00b0f0">Sebastian</font>. He maintains strict rules about who may or may not enter the city as well as who may remain after the gates are shut at dusk every night to protect the residents from the dangers beyond the walls.

>[!tip] A Cult Rising
>
>A little over twenty years ago, a middle-aged, bald man with dark brown skin asked for admittance to <font color="#ffff00">Saint Sebastian</font> after sundown. <font color="#00b0f0">Sebastian</font> refused, which was functionally a death sentence. Between the witches, wildlings, werewolves, and vampire spawn, the man would surely be devoured in the dark. The man sat in front of the gates, a lantern by his side.
>
>Dawn rose the next day, and the man remained. He walked through the city streets, preaching a message of hope and light, of safety beyond the walls, so long as the residents remained in his care. Many joined him. 
>
>After the first year, a wave of refugees fled from <font color="#ffff00">Barasov</font> to <font color="#ffff00">Saint Sebastian</font>, and they too joined the **Ring of Light**. They built wooden shelters around the city, leaning them against <font color="#ffff00">Saint Sebastian’s</font> sturdy walls.

## Barasov

<font color="#ffff00">Barasov</font> is the largest, most developed city in all of <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font>. Though officially ruled by Lady Divine <font color="#00b0f0">Odalyde</font>, functionally, it is divided into three sections: that ruled by the nobles, the **Bloodletters**, and the **Watchers**. The nobility’s portion of the city is the wealthiest, and each of the five families has ties to either the **Bloodletters** or the **Watchers**. 

A sharp line runs through the city between the **Bloodletters**’ and the **Watchers**’ territory. Residents pay for protection depending on which of the two sections they call home, though for the most part, the citizens of <font color="#ffff00">Barasov</font> try to remain separate from the inter-guild conflicts. 

Twenty years ago, the fighting between the two guilds intensified to the point that blood ran through the streets and many innocents died, caught in the crossfire. Those who could fled the city and made their way to <font color="#ffff00">Saint Sebastian</font> and <font color="#ffff00">Willowhold</font>. 

>[!warning] Leaving Barasov
>A mysterious fog hangs over the minds of those who leave <font color="#ffff00">Barasov</font>, slowly erasing their memories of the city, making recollection more difficult the longer they are away. 

>[!note] Worldbuilding Note
>The human residents of <font color="#ffff00">Barasov</font> oppress the other races of their city, especially those of goblinoid descent. The degree of this oppression is up to the DM and what they and the party feel comfortable with. If the adventurers would like to tackle inequality, racism, and hatred, then this can be an interesting plotline. Make sure to address this out of game, and feel free to cut it entirely, or explore issues of class inequality that are not tied to race or appearance.

## Rasonov

Not much is known of this city to the east of <font color="#00b0f0">Draego’s</font> castle, but groups of hooded riders occasionally burst forth from its gates, quelling disturbances in the countryside before returning to their homes. No one in <font color="#ffff00">Barasov</font> or S<font color="#ffff00">aint Sebastian</font> has had contact with a citizen of <font color="#ffff00">Rasonov</font> for several decades. 

Nevertheless, several rumors persist about the place and its formidable walls. Some say that <font color="#ffff00">Rasonov</font> is populated by sentient, isolationist ghouls. Others claim that <font color="#ffff00">Rasonov</font> is the home of a mad wizard who protects incredible treasures in the labyrinth within the walls. The most improbable claim is that it is within <font color="#ffff00">Rasonov</font> that resistance to <font color="#00b0f0">Draego’s</font> dominion over <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font> gathers strength.

## Willowhold

The small settlement of <font color="#ffff00">Willowhold</font> sits in the middle of the <font color="#7030a0">Witchwood</font>, its residents protecting themselves from the horrors of the forest as best as they’re able. So far, the residents have managed to beat back the ever-encroaching <font color="#7030a0">Witchwood</font> and ward off the many horrors of the wild.

## Castle Cadogan 

Lord <font color="#00b0f0">Draego</font> and his son <font color="#00b0f0">Cadogan</font> live in <font color="#00b050">Castle Cadogan</font>, a towering structure built into the region’s tallest mountain, and the village of <font color="#ffff00">Umbra</font> lies at the castle’s base. The vampire lord has few interactions with the villagers below, though they dwell always beneath the castle’s shadow.
