# Geographical Features

There are many geographical features of the land of Steymhorod. Many treacherous creatures and environments exist within.

## Witchwood

The <font color="#7030a0">Witchwood</font> is a vast forest that spans the region of <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font>. Like all the lands of <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font>, the fall to the <font color="#ff0000">Shadowlands</font> corrupted the wood and its residents. A single path, the <font color="#7030a0">Spindlewood Road</font>, curls through the forest, connecting the vast woodland to the other elements of the region. The <font color="#7030a0">Witchwood</font> is ever-expanding, slowly encroaching on neighboring cities and towns as well as the fields and rivers.  

## Wolf’s Head Peak

Far to the north, a pack of werewolves have made their home in <font color="#7030a0">Wolf’s Head Peak</font>. Their alphas, <font color="#00b0f0">Tavion</font> and <font color="#00b0f0">Solane</font>, have led the pack for the last decade, but a rogue member of their pack, <font color="#00b0f0">Vicq</font>, vies for power. 

## Green Vale

The <font color="#7030a0">Green Vale</font> resides in the southern reaches of Steymhorod and is the sole remaining fae forest in the land. The first several acres of forest are disguised by a false <font color="#7030a0">Witchwood</font>, but within its borders, a conclave of fae and druids remain in harmony with the land of <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font>. They are divided as to their responsibility to the rest of the land. Over the years, a few different groups have attempted to revive the **Sisters’ Fanes** while others have made pacts with the vampires, werewolves, or the witches. 

While they would say that they are unaware of whether or not Lord <font color="#00b0f0">Draego</font> knows of their whereabouts, the wisest among them would hold this as a certainty—when he destroyed the **Sisters**, <font color="#00b0f0">Draego</font> became one with the land. ***He knows of all within its borders.*** 

## Four Fanes

There are four fanes, or sacred sites of the **Sisters**. In <font color="#00b0f0">Draego’s</font> rage at the **Sisters’** betrayal, he destroyed the fanes, and the records of their locations were lost over time. Each **Sister** had a fane at the heart of her element: <font color="#00b0f0">Diannan</font>, the Forest Fane; <font color="#00b0f0">Arduenne</font>, the Mountain Fane, <font color="#00b0f0">Eronia</font>, the Field Fane; and <font color="#00b0f0">Lena</font>, the River Fane.
