# The History of Steymhorod

**Several thousand years ago, the land of <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font> disappeared from the surface of <font color="#ff0000">Eldura</font>.**

What had once been a mountainous region with fragrant springs, moderate summers, and colorful falls descended into the <font color="#ff0000">Shadowlands</font>, its borders *separated from the rest of the plane* by impenetrable mist.

At all times, <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font> remains under gray clouds, lit only by weak sunlight even at the brightest points of the day. The forests linger on the cusp between autumn and winter, a state of living death.

**And over the land, a dark vampire lord, <font color="#00b0f0">Draego</font>, rules.**

>[!info] Context
Those who live on the prime plane—several thousand years later in <font color="#ff0000">Azuria</font>—are unfamiliar with what happened to the land of <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font>. Over the millennia since the region descended into the <font color="#ff0000">Shadowlands</font>, few have ventured across its borders. For non-vampires, such a visit is impossible save through the use of a portal.

The muddled history of the years before the flood obscured the history of <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font> further still, and characters are unlikely to have heard of the region at all—its very memory has left the prime plane. When your party arrives, they do not know where they are, and this will be one of their chief initial concerns as they grow acquainted with the region.

## The Fall

While <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font> was still a prosperous land in the northwestern reaches of <font color="#ff0000">Eldura</font>, major and minor nobles from across the realms arrived, hoping to win the fancy and hand of the young Lord <font color="#00b0f0">Draego</font>, the noble ruler of all of <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod.</font> To everyone’s surprise, a minor noblewoman, <font color="#00b0f0">Elena</font> of <font color="#ffc000">Palais</font>, captured the lord’s attention. The captivating <font color="#00b0f0">Elena</font> left <font color="#ffc000">Palais</font> behind, and she remained with Lord <font color="#00b0f0">Draego</font> and became his wife.

Unfortunately, the couple’s happiness would be short-lived. While pregnant with their first-born child, <font color="#00b0f0">Elena</font> became ill and needed a blood transfusion. One of her trusted servants agreed and offered her lifeblood for her mistress—but the blood was cursed. <font color="#00b0f0">Elena’s</font> condition worsened. Large, seeping pustules covered her skin, keeping her in a constant state of agony. She could often be heard screaming late into the night of the fire licking her skin and rushing through her blood. 

<font color="#00b0f0">Draego</font> became obsessed with the blood curse. He waged an all-out war against surrounding kingdoms, thinking that by collecting blood he might find a cure for his ailing wife. It was said that in the <font color="#7030a0">Killing Fields</font> of <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font>, the earth and the grasses drank more blood than water and developed a taste for wet red death. But despite all of this loss of life as <font color="#00b0f0">Draego</font> expanded the reach of his kingdom, no cure could be found.

Lord <font color="#00b0f0">Draego</font> was desperate. He called upon his allies, the **Four Sister Fanes**, ancient Fae beings tied to the land and with whom he shared influence, love, and control over all of <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font>. Though he begged, they refused to help him save <font color="#00b0f0">Elena</font> or the child. <font color="#00b0f0">Draego</font> attacked as they turned their back on him, destroying those who had been his allies for so long. **The Sisters** died alongside <font color="#00b0f0">Elena</font>, and the land fell into the <font color="#ff0000">Shadowlands</font>, cursed. 

A small flicker of light remained. The child lived, delivered as his mother passed on to the realm of <font color="#ff0000">Astralei</font>. The distraught father did his best to raise his son and rule his land, but further tragedy awaited <font color="#00b0f0">Draego</font>. A few months into his young life, the healers discovered that <font color="#00b0f0">Cadogan</font> also had the blood disorder that had killed his mother. 

**The Sisters** having failed him, <font color="#00b0f0">Draego</font> turned to a new set of powers, crying out for aid from any who would listen. <font color="#00b0f0">Xarmev</font>, god of undeath, answered him. The god promised to heal the boy and vowed that he and <font color="#00b0f0">Draego</font> would live forever. *<font color="#00b0f0">Draego</font> agreed, and the first vampire came into being.*

>[!info] Known vs. Unknown
>Most people in <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font> are unaware of the fact that they live in the <font color="#ff0000">Shadowlands</font>. Similarly, the common understanding of what transpired with the fall or the Darkening is that the **Four Sisters** left—very few know of <font color="#00b0f0">Draego’s</font> connection to their disappearance.
