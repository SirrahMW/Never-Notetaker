# People Groups of Steymhorod

<font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font> is a primarily human plane that is ruled by a vampire lord and also home to werewolves, witches, fae, and saudad. 

## Vampires

Lord <font color="#00b0f0">Draego</font>, the first vampire, created several others in the early throes of his immortality. His deal with <font color="#00b0f0">Xarmev</font> inflicted his son with his curse, and he passed the bloodline on to a few others, most notably his military commander <font color="#00b0f0">Malthael</font> and his chief political strategist, <font color="#00b0f0">Hugo</font>. All vampires remain under <font color="#00b0f0">Draego’s</font> thrall and are connected to him on some level, but he cannot directly harm them, just as he cannot harm himself.

<font color="#00b0f0">Draego’s</font> blood flows through the veins of all vampires. The further they are from the original, the weaker they are in their cursed state. There are two remaining vampires of the elder bloodline: <font color="#00b0f0">Malthael</font> and <font color="#00b0f0">Hugo</font>. <font color="#00b0f0">Malthael’s</font> servants are violent and bloodthirsty, wreaking havoc on the prime plane with large-scale slaughters. <font color="#00b0f0">Hugo’s</font> descendants are more conniving, selecting their targets with care and concocting intricate schemes to avoid detection. 

<font color="#00b0f0">Nassarq’s</font> transformation occurred with the help of an ancient relic that he discovered from <font color="#00b0f0">Xarmev’s</font> servants. He directly imbibed <font color="#00b0f0">Hugo’s</font> blood, reviving the elder line and amassing great power to himself over a short period of time. Three vampires—<font color="#00b0f0">Rodian</font>, <font color="#00b0f0">Olya</font>, and <font color="#00b0f0">Anya</font>—owe their souls to <font color="#00b0f0">Hugo</font>, either through their transformations or on behalf of deals they made with him, and they are likewise bound to serve <font color="#00b0f0">Nassarq</font>, <font color="#00b0f0">Hugo’s</font> blood-reincarnation.   

## Werewolves

>[!warning] Caution: Spoilers!
>We suggest the GM keep this information concealed from the players until they are interacting with werewolves in the adventure. These altered curse rules are meant to help increase the threat of curses and diseases which lose a lot of their power with even low-level spellcasting. Being a cursed land, Steymhorod enhances these predicaments, but ultimately, this change is up to the GM.

With <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod’s</font> fall, the curse of lycanthropy worsened in <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font>. The pack originally served <font color="#00b0f0">Arduenne</font>, the Fae goddess of the mountains, but without her presence, their wolf side was corrupted alongside all the native wolves of the region. They remain loyal to <font color="#00b0f0">Arduenne</font>, worshipping an aspect of her spirit, the <font color="#00b0f0">Wolf Mother</font>. Lycanthropy in <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font> cannot be healed save for the intervention—and therefore resurrection—of <font color="#00b0f0">Arduenne</font> herself. 

## Witches

The witches were once the devoted followers of <font color="#00b0f0">Diannan</font>, the leader of the **Sisters** and the Archfae ruler of the forest. When their fae goddess disappeared, the witches’ magic twisted, the spirits they called warped by shadow. Their desire to protect the <font color="#7030a0">Forest Fane</font> remains, and they hunt trespassers through their lands, especially those who stray from the <font color="#7030a0">Spindle Path</font> that winds through the woods, crossing rivers and valleys. 

The witches hold sway over two other groups that roam the lands of <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font> as well: the wildlings and the wights. The wildlings roam the forests, hunting creatures and travelers alike. If called upon, they will do the witches’ bidding for a favor or a fee, though they are also willing to work for the vampires. 

The wights travel in a mounted herd, roaming the fields between the forest and the city of <font color="#ffff00">Barasov</font> in ghostly armor. Several rumors circulate through the lands as to the nature of their hunts, be they for food, vengeance, entertainment, or another cause. Their leader is missing her right hand, lost in a battle long ago. 

## Fae

Fae from both the <font color="#ff0000">Bright</font>- and <font color="#ff0000">Shadowlands</font> reside in the <font color="#7030a0">Green Vale</font>, teaching a conclave of druids and green witches their ways. A few other fae roam the lands of <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font> in disguise, disrupting the habits of the other people groups save the saudad, for whom they have a fondness. 

## Saudad

The saudad are interplanar travelers, displaced from the city of <font color="#ffff00">Orison</font> after it was swallowed by the ocean as <font color="#00b0f0">Ruka’s</font> sacrifice to <font color="#00b0f0">Alessandra</font>. A small enclave of saudad were traveling through <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font> when it fell into the <font color="#ff0000">Shadowlands</font>, and they have been trapped ever since, unable to venture the multiverse. The saudad are storytellers and maintain much of the lore of old, down to when <font color="#00b0f0">Lewellyn</font> and <font color="#00b0f0">Pandora</font> brought the planes into existence. They travel freely across <font color="#00b0f0">Draego’s</font> lands unhindered by vampires, his responsibility for their plight resulting in a rare moment of compassion on behalf of the vampire lord. 

>[!info] **Saudad** in <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font>
>Their extensive cultural memory helps to protect them from the evils that walk the land as well. While many of the townsfolk and those hiding behind the walls of <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod’s</font> cities remain unaware of how to protect themselves from the wandering undead, witches, and werewolves, the saudad remember, passing the knowledge down through generations. Their leaders have ties to the **Sisters**, and many saudad have a close relationship with the natural world as keepers of her stories.
