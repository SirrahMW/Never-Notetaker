# History

The worlds began as one and have grown more distant ever since as the planes have drifted further apart, much like the peoples who inhabit them. **What is writ large between the gods finds its reflection in mortal hearts, causing divisions between kingdoms, families, and even the self.**

## Creation of Azuria

**There were originally eight planes of energy: Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Nature, Space, Light, and Darkness.** The **Plane of Nature** drew to the center of these and became the three **Planes of Life**: the prime plane (<font color="#ff0000">Eldura</font>/<font color="#ff0000">Azuria</font>) and its two reflections, the Fae <font color="#ff0000">Brightlands</font> and the Realm of Shadow or <font color="#ff0000">Shadowlands</font>. The **Plane of Space** helped the **Plane of Nature** to divide herself into three and filled in the new gaps between the realms. The **Plane of Space** also makes up the **Star Plane**, where mortal souls go after death. 

The remaining six planes make up the **Elemental Planes**: Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Light, and Darkness. 

In addition to these are the **Immortal Planes**, divided by **Negative** and **Positive** energies and orientations and ruled by the prime goddesses, <font color="#00b0f0">Pandora</font> and <font color="#00b0f0">Llewellyn</font>.

Gods and Goddesses of Azuria: [[Deities]]

## The Fall of the First Age – 8,000 years ago

<font color="#00b0f0">Alessandra</font>, the first champion of the **Titan of Light**, <font color="#00b0f0">Ilona</font>, the leader of the Titans, betrayed the Titans and the other five champions. She called upon the winged agents of the Negative Planes to aid her and stepped into the void <font color="#00b0f0">Pandora</font> had left behind.

The war waged for one thousand years. At its end, the Negative and Positive Planes separated themselves from the Planes of Life and the Elemental Planes.  

### Alessandra’s Betrayal

The Champion of Light, <font color="#00b0f0">Alessandra</font>, turned against the other champions she had fought alongside for the past age and destroyed the five of them on the battlefield in one fell swoop. She used their energy to arise to a position of godhood. 

### The Fall of Orison – 100 Years Later 

The massacre of an entire city, set in motion by <font color="#00b0f0">Ruka</font> (the champion of water and protector of <font color="#ffff00">Orison</font>), signaled an end to the First Age.

>[!info] <font color="#00b0f0">Ruka's</font> Foul Rite
<font color="#00b0f0">Ruka</font> sacrificed the souls of the city of <font color="#ffff00">Orison</font> in a foul rite to <font color="#00b0f0">Alessandra</font> and rose to godhood himself. The Champion of Water rose to a position of power on his island home, <font color="#ffff00">Orison</font>, by helping to manage wars and campaigns. But his loyalty shifted as he encountered the dark goddess <font color="#00b0f0">Alessandra</font> and her allies: <font color="#00b0f0">Braemorn</font>, god of murder and <font color="#00b0f0">Xarmev</font>, god of undeath and the grave. Some scholars believe that in a dark ritual, written in the blood of innocents in a cursed book, <font color="#00b0f0">Ruka</font> traded the souls of the City of <font color="#ffff00">Orison</font> to <font color="#00b0f0">Alessandra</font> to ascend as a deity himself. 

Out of this tragedy, the saudad’s special relationship with <font color="#00b0f0">Cassandra</font> arose. She adopted the scattered travelers as her own and made their home the stories along the threads of fate.

To put a stop to <font color="#00b0f0">Ruka</font> and <font color="#00b0f0">Alessandra</font>, the elder gods increased the distances between the Planes of Life, and most of the original peoples returned to their native planes. From then on, humans, then called the **Lycan**, would make up the majority of the peoples of the Material Plane. 

As <font color="#00b0f0">Alessandra’s</font> power grew, so did the threat to the peoples across the Planes of Life. Her aggressions forced the <font color="#00b0f0">Enid</font> to return to the <font color="#ff0000">Brightlands</font>. The daimon, too, retreated. <font color="#00b0f0">Fenrir’s</font> first people, the **Lycan**, spread across the prime plane. 

### The Disappearance of Steymhorod – 1050 Years Later

Life continued across the planes in spite of the darkness that spread from corner to corner of the worlds. An ambitious young lord, <font color="#00b0f0">Xander Rasvan Draego</font>, met and married a young noblewoman, <font color="#00b0f0">Elena</font>, and brought her into the idyllic kingdom of <font color="#ff0000">Steymhorod</font>. 

The couple’s happiness was short-lived, however, as <font color="#00b0f0">Elena</font> contracted a blood-sickness shortly after conceiving their first son, <font color="#00b0f0">Cadogan</font>. In his desperation to save his wife, Draego waged a war in search of a cure for the blood-sickness, but to no avail. <font color="#00b0f0">Elena’s</font> spirit left her body on the eve of the day she was to give birth, the day <font color="#00b0f0">Draego</font> captured the traitorous **Fae Sisters** and rent them from their sacred homes across his domain. <font color="#ffc000">Steymhorod</font> fell into the <font color="#ff0000">Shadowlands</font>, where it has remained, locked away, ever since.

## The Fall of Eldura (5000 Years Ago)

Wars continued across the lands of <font color="#ff0000">Eldura</font>. Many centuries saw peace. Many more saw war. The final age of <font color="#ff0000">Eldura</font>, in the second war of a thousand years, called the War of the Champions, the **Titans** put up a final fight against <font color="#00b0f0">Alessandra</font> and her allies. Three **Titans**, <font color="#00b0f0">Thalyssa</font>, <font color="#00b0f0">Gaia</font>, and <font color="#00b0f0">Nyx</font>, withdrew their planes from connection with the **Planes of Life** so as to protect their home spheres and those who lived there. <font color="#00b0f0">Atamos</font>, <font color="#00b0f0">Ignis</font>, and <font color="#00b0f0">Ilona</font> continued to fight. 

The **Champions** of **Earth**, **Darkness**, and **Water**, whose **Titans** had left, saw a great decrease in their own power, and they were little match for the advanced forces of darkness pouring across the **Material Plane**. They fell quickly to their enemies, and the tide of the war turned. 

<font color="#00b0f0">Alessandra</font> toppled several city-states, and they began a cruel torture of the **Champions** to destroy the morale of those who aligned themselves with them, called the ***Severing***. They separated the **Champions**’ souls from their bodies and turned their bodies into crystalline statues. They buried these statues across the **Material Plane**. In time, they perfected this process and were able to kill the **Champions** outright after several days of torture. A special order, called the **Soul Shepherds**, tried to recover the **Champions** who had been severed and reunite them with their souls. They were able to recover a few. 

At the end of the war, given little other choice, the final three **Titans** withdrew. Their remaining **Champions** fell to the **Severing** and <font color="#ffff00">Respite</font>, the greatest city-state of the age, was overcome.

## The Great Flood—The Passage from Eldura to Azuria

Surviving urban centers flourished after the **War of the Champions**, especially <font color="#00b0f0">Alessandra’s</font> city in T<font color="#7030a0">he Howling Wastes</font>. The city-states that became <font color="#ffff00">Hadvar</font> and <font color="#ffff00">Andel-ce Hevra</font> grew in this time as well. However, the prominence in the forces of darkness during this period brought about great unbalance. 

Druids, sages, and elves warned of a coming doom; the **Material Plane** could not bear or balance the rapidity of changes and destruction of the natural world. But the peoples of <font color="#ff0000">Eldura</font> ignored them. Calamities increased, and prayers to <font color="#00b0f0">Kleodna</font>, the goddess of the sea, went unanswered. Waters rose, and the sea reclaimed lands it had left thousands of years before. <font color="#00b0f0">Yena</font>, too, was silent as fires ravaged the few remaining forests. 

Only one woodland remained, the home of the **Sapphire Circle**. Few are privy to the **Circle**’s disappearance, but the saudad have their sources, even inside the secret societies that have continued on in the wake of <font color="#ff0000">Eldura’s</font> loss. The **Sapphire Circle** banded together and removed their forest to the <font color="#ff0000">Shadowlands</font>. The surface of the prime plane flooded, millions died, civilizations were destroyed, and the world was unrecognizable from what it had been before. 

>[!info] Birth of Azuria
><font color="#ff0000">Eldura</font> was no more. As the few remaining peoples sought to pick up the pieces of the lives they had known, they discovered that their world had been remade and was now divided by an impossibly large ocean. It was thus that the <font color="#7030a0">Infinite Ocean</font> got her name, and <font color="#ff0000">Azuria</font> was born.
