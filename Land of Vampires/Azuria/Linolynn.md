# Linolynn

The city-state of **<font color="#ffff00">Linolynn</font>** is located on the western shores of the continent **<font color="#ffc000">Caldara</font>** in the world of **<font color="#ff0000">Azuria</font>**. It is the newest and most modest of the three major Caldaran city-states, with **<font color="#ffff00">Hadvar</font>** to its north and **<font color="#ffff00">Cyrinia</font>** to the south. To Linolynn’s east lies the free city and trading port of **<font color="#ffff00">Red’s Cross</font>** near the **<font color="#7030a0">Frostmaw Mountains</font>**, and the **<font color="#7030a0">Stormside Forest</font>** stretches across the lands to the north. The city of Linolynn is made up of four wards: the Earth and Water Wards, the Air Ward, and the Castle Ward. The Earth and Water Wards hold the majority of the city’s residents, and they surround the Air Ward which, in turn, wraps around the Castle Ward.

> Disparity in income and class is a growing concern for <font color="#ffff00">Linolynn’s</font> young king, <font color="#00b0f0">Arontis</font>, who has made some forays into addressing inequality in the city, but it remains to be seen whether his efforts will take effect before the city’s people attempt more dramatic interventions.

## The Earth Ward
The largest of the city’s wards, the Earth Ward possesses several groups of residential districts interspersed with markets, inns, taverns, and shops. Many of this ward’s residents work on farms outside the city walls while others assist the craftspersons and wealthier merchants and families of the Air or Castle Wards. Residents of Linolynn who wish to visit temples to <font color="#00b0f0">Veloni</font>, the god of agriculture, or <font color="#00b0f0">Vida</font>, goddess of rain, can find their temples here, surrounding by well-kept parks with smaller shrines to the deities of the seasons: <font color="#00b0f0">Zivena</font>, goddess of life and spring; <font color="#00b0f0">Yena</font>, goddess of fire, heat, and summer; <font color="#00b0f0">Gwenyth</font>, goddess of autumn and the harvest; and <font color="#00b0f0">Marena</font>, goddess of winter and death.
## The Water Ward
The seaside city of Linolynn possesses an impressive navy for a metropolis of its size. These ships rest closest to the cliffside beneath <font color="#00b050">Io Keep</font> with the smaller docks open to Linolynn’s populace stretching along the city’s coastline. Fresh fish markets sit just off the docks where fishers’ families can sell the day’s catch to other city residents or tavern keepers. An expansive temple to <font color="#00b0f0">Kleodna</font>, goddess of the sea and passions, sits near the wall that separates the Water Ward from the Air Ward. Most of the lower-ranking members of Linolynn’s navy live in this ward as well.
## The Air Ward
The Air Ward sits at a higher elevation on the cliffside above the Earth and Water Wards, separated from the lower wards by a stone wall. Aside from the nobility, the city’s wealthiest residents reside here. The Air Ward also prides itself on being home to artists and fine craftspersons, though of course they come from established or up and-coming lines. Many of the Ward’s craftspersons employ apprentices from the Earth and Water Wards. The Air Ward’s merchants provide goods and services for the Castle Ward’s nobles, and many of the wealthiest families regularly attend events in <font color="#00b050">Io Keep</font>. Most members of the City Watch live in dormitories in the Air Ward set aside for this purpose, though some choose to remain in the Earth or Water Wards with their families. Most of the city’s high-ranking priests live in this ward and work either in the Temple of <font color="#00b0f0">A’thea</font>, god of trade and commerce favored by the city’s merchants, or the Sun Temple, dedicated to the goddess <font color="#00b0f0">Arrinia</font>, that also serves a house of worship for deities without a temple of their own.
## The Castle Ward
The Castle Ward centers around the sweeping arches and stone walls of <font color="#00b050">Io Keep</font>, a pale gray castle characterized by brilliant glass windows and its position at the top of the cliff-face beside the <font color="#7030a0">Infinite Ocean</font>. <font color="#00b050">Io Keep</font> has extensive grounds, gardens, and a carefully maintained Arboretum home to each known species of tree and plant in the city-state and its surroundings. The oldest noble families possess wings of their own inside the castle, and the minor nobility live in elegant guest wings during their visits to court. In addition to its highest-ranking residents, including the royal family, <font color="#00b050">Io Keep</font> also houses the Royal Guard, and barracks for lower-tier soldiers in the city’s army line the walls that separate the Castle and Air Wards. Members of the cavalry dwell in Scholars and sages have rooms near the Librarium, where they meet and study when not advising the king or his courtiers. Palace servants not assigned to a particular family live in the lower levels near the kitchens.
