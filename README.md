# Welcome
This github repo is for backing up and distributing an Obsidian vault dedicated to Dungeons & Dragons campaign notes. 
I'm never very good at taking notes, and it always ends up biting me in the ass since my memory is shit.
This is me making an attempt at collaboratively note-keeping for myself and friends.
## Setup
1. The first step in setting up the obsidian vault is to install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download)! Navigate to the hyperlink and download Obisidian for whatever OS you are running (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.)

2. Proceed through the installation as you would with any other desktop application.

__(Your installation location may be different from the screenshot below, that is fine)__

3. Next, you'll want to download this repo and extract it to a location you can easily find. (Documents folder, desktop, etc.)

4. Open up Obsidian and you'll see a screen like the one below. Use the "Open folder as vault" and navigate to where you saved the extracted repo (The folder you choose should have the hidden `.obsidian` folder in it).

5. You will get a popup asking to trust the author of the vault when you first open the vault. I presume you trust me to not include anything malicious since this is designed to be used by friends. I highly recommend selecting "Trust author and enable plugins", but the vault is theoretically mostly usable without these plugins or with entirely different plugins included.

6. You should be all set! I recommend poking around the settings and changing the settings or appearance however you want. Both the "Appearance" and "Minimal Theme Settings" tabs are used for a majority of the appearance customizations, but there's also other community themes you can acquire through the "Appearance" tab if the "Minimal" theme isn't to your liking.
